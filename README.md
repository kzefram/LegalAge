# LegalAge

## Description

This was created as part of my course assignments while taking 'Introduction to Coding - C#' at NBCC-Saint John. I made it the legal age for my daughter to play with because she is always asking if she's old enough. I had a lot of fun creating this application.

There are 3 options: underage, legal age, and still going.
